  - [x] Show progress bar for assessment completion
  - [x] Add estimated time remaining
  - [x] Display current skill being assessed

### **3.2 Improve Response Display**

- [x] **Optimize message rendering**
  - [x] Add typing indicators during AI generation
  - [x] Implement progressive message loading
  - [x] Add response time indicators
  - [x] Improve Arabic text rendering and RTL support

### **3.3 Enhanced Error Handling**

  - [x] Add timeout warnings after 30 seconds
  - [x] Implement retry buttons for failed requests
  - [x] Show connection status indicators
  - [x] Add graceful degradation for slow responses

---

## ðŸ”§ **Phase 4: Infrastructure Optimizations (Low Priority)**

### **4.1 Caching Strategy**
