      "taskTitle": "Setup Convex Database Schema and Functions",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema creation into defining tables for users, skills, assessments, and learning paths; implement Convex functions for assessment lifecycle and data retrieval; design indexing strategies; create validation schemas; and write unit and integration tests.",
      "reasoning": "Designing a relational schema with multiple interrelated tables and implementing corresponding Convex functions requires careful planning for data integrity, indexing, and validation. Convex's schema and indexing constraints add complexity, especially for arrays and references, necessitating multiple focused subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Skill Selection Interface",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into building the Next.js dropdown component with skill fetching, implementing RTL/LTR layout support for Arabic and English, and adding navigation and state management with loading and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "While UI dropdowns are common, supporting bilingual RTL/LTR layouts and integrating with Convex data fetching adds moderate complexity. State management and navigation require careful handling but follow standard React/Next.js patterns."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split into building responsive chat UI with message bubbles and typing indicators, implementing real-time updates via WebSocket or polling, adding JSON detection and chat completion triggers, and ensuring accessibility and bilingual text rendering.",
      "reasoning": "Real-time chat interfaces with JSON detection and multi-language support require integration of UI responsiveness, asynchronous data handling, and accessibility considerations, making this moderately complex."

      "taskTitle": "Configure Gemini Flash AI Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for creating server-side API routes, implementing conversation state and context management, injecting dynamic system prompts, adding retry and error handling logic, and securing API keys with performance and security testing.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating an external AI API with dynamic prompt injection, conversation context tracking, and robust error handling involves backend complexity and security concerns, requiring multiple focused subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement AI System Prompt with Module Templates",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into designing AI role and conversation rules, defining JSON output format and validation, creating module templates for skill levels and content types, and including examples and dynamic difficulty adaptation instructions.",
      "reasoning": "Crafting a comprehensive AI system prompt with structured templates and strict output rules requires prompt engineering expertise and careful design to ensure consistent AI behavior."

      "taskTitle": "Create Learning Path Preview Component",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split into designing UI for module display with progress tracking, integrating with Convex DB for data fetching and updates, and supporting bilingual layouts with responsive design.",
      "reasoning": "UI component development with progress tracking and database integration is moderately complex but follows common frontend patterns, with added bilingual support increasing complexity slightly."
